# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks organized by experiment type:

## 📁 Structure

- **01_data_exploration/**: Initial data analysis, visualization, and understanding
- **02_preprocessing/**: Data cleaning, augmentation, and preparation
- **03_baseline_models/**: Implementation of baseline re-identification methods
- **04_advanced_models/**: Advanced deep learning approaches and novel architectures
- **05_evaluation/**: Model evaluation, comparison, and metrics analysis

## 💡 Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with prefixes for ordering:
- `01_dataset_overview.ipynb`
- `02_image_quality_analysis.ipynb`
- `03_feature_visualization.ipynb`

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Start with data exploration notebooks to understand your dataset
2. Use preprocessing notebooks to prepare your data
3. Implement baseline models for comparison
4. Experiment with advanced approaches
5. Evaluate and compare all methods

Each notebook should be self-contained and well-documented with markdown cells explaining the methodology and results.
