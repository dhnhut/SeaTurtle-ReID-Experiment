## 🐢 About Sea Turtle Re-Identification

Sea turtle re-identification is a computer vision task that aims to identify individual turtles across different images and time periods. This is essential for:

- **Population monitoring**: Tracking individual turtles over time
- **Migration studies**: Understanding movement patterns
- **Conservation efforts**: Assessing population health and trends
- **Behavioral analysis**: Studying turtle behavior and habitat use

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Baseline Implementation**: Implement and evaluate existing re-identification methods
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Develop robust preprocessing pipelines for turtle images
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract meaningful features for turtle identification
4. **Deep Learning Models**: Experiment with CNN architectures and attention mechanisms
5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive evaluation using standard re-ID metrics
6. **Performance Optimization**: Improve accuracy and efficiency of identification systems

## 📊 Key Features

- **Interactive Notebooks**: Well-documented Jupyter notebooks for each experiment
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components and utility functions
- **Visualization Tools**: Comprehensive data visualization and result analysis
- **Metric Evaluation**: Standard re-identification metrics (mAP, CMC, etc.)
- **Reproducible Research**: Clear documentation and reproducible experiments
